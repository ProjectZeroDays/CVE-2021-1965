# CVE-2021-1965
CVE-2021-1965 WiFi Zero Click RCE Trigger PoC

This is a quick&dirty Proof-of-Concept code to verify if your phone is vulnerable. After running the poc code, your phone is supposed to crash&reboot within seconds. In case you need more info about the bug & vulnerable code, here you are:

Description: Possible buffer overflow due to lack of parameter length check during MBSSID scan IE parse

During multiple BSSID scan ie parse, there is memory allocation on new_ie variable of size 1024 which may create buffer overflow in util_gen_new_ie() if ie length is greater than 1024.

## Setting up the cron job

To automate the execution of the script, you can set up a cron job to run the script at a specified interval. Follow these steps:

1. Open the crontab file by running `crontab -e` in the terminal.
2. Add a new line with the desired schedule and the command to execute the script. For example, to run the script every minute, add the following line:
   ```
   * * * * * /path/to/CVE-2021-1965-poc
   ```

## Testing the script

To test the script, follow these steps:

1. Compile the script using a C compiler, for example:
   ```
   gcc -o CVE-2021-1965-poc CVE-2021-1965-poc.c -lpcap
   ```
2. Run the compiled script:
   ```
   ./CVE-2021-1965-poc
   ```
3. Check if the script connects back to `zeroclickexploits.ddns.net` and auto executes as expected.
